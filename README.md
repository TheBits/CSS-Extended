Caches completions on document save.

* If the document is a .css file (stand alone file) it will add any symbols that are found to the main project index.

* If the document is a .html/.php it will parse that file and extract any classes/IDs found within style tags and only show you those completions, plus any from the main project cache.

property/value completions such as `box-sizing`, additional font names for `font-family`, `animation`, `flex-box`, etc...

You can delete the cache via the command palette `CSS Completions: Delete Cache`

### [Emmet](http://emmet.io) Support

Emmet support is enabled by default, you just need to add the following to your User Settings:

```json
"auto_complete_selector": "source - comment, meta.tag - punctuation.definition.tag.begin, text.html.basic"
```

Don't have Emmet? No problem, you won't have any problems with it being enable by default.  
Still want to disable Emmet support? Just set `"use_emmet": false` in the user's package settings
